Known -> Known crosspost
========================

This plugin links a user on one known site to a user on another known site, allowing you to cross post (most) content.

Primarily this was written as a test/proof of concept for my OAuth2 Server <https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownOAuth2>, but might actually be useful to some people - for example, 
if you have a corporate known blog and want to post to it from your personal blog.

Usage
-----

* Install in your plugins
* Create your application on the server you want to post to
* Enter those details into the account on the server you want to post from
* Go through your standard oauth linking

TODO
----

* [x] Status posts
* [x] Text posts
* [ ] Image posts
* [ ] Location posts
